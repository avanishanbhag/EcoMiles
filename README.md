Climate change is something growing day by day and its impacting wildlife around us and reducing the quality of life. That's why we want to create a project that can promote a healthy environment around us. 
The problem we are trying to solve is reducing people's carbon footprint. We want to solve this issue because carbon footprint refers to the amount of greenhouse gases that are released that can severely contribute to climate change. 
This app will explore is how people's chosen methods of transportation affect their carbon footprint throughout the day.
